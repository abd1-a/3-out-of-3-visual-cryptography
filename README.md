#k OUT OF n VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY ALGORITHMS

The proposed algorithm for visual cryptography is used to generate n shares using the encryption algorithms with a specified value of k and n from the user. All n shares are used to generate a recovered image, which is the encrypted version of the input image, which is then decrypted by simply stacking k shares together.

3 out of 3 scheme n = 3 means three shares will be produced to encrypt an image. This scheme needs three shares to recover the secret image by superimposing the four shared subpixels, and consists of exactly four pixels for each pixel in the secret image.
